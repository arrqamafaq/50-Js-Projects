# 50 JavaScript Projects

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering JavaScript and DOM manipulation by completing 50 projects. The main objective is to minimize hardcoding HTML and focus on dynamically creating and manipulating elements through JavaScript.

Each project demonstrates a unique concept or feature, with a live preview link and a screenshot to visualize the result.
